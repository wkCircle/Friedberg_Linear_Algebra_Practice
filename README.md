## My solutions to almost all exercises of the textbook problems (till Section 7.1).
Textbook: [Linear Algebra, 4th Edition, Stehpehn H. Friedberg, Arnold J. Insel, Lawrence E. Spence](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-4th-Stephen-Friedberg/dp/0130084514) <br />
> - The textbook contains 7 chapters.
> - My solutions cover sections from 1.3 to 7.1, totally **122 pages**.
> - Since I didn't refer to any others' solutions, my solutions could provide as alternative directions of thoughts to users but inevitably have some mistakes or wrong spellings. 
> - **Any correction and suggestion are welcomed!**
